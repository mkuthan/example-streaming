/**
 * A toll station is a common phenomenon. You encounter them on many expressways, bridges, and tunnels across the world.
 * Each toll station has multiple toll booths. At manual booths, you stop to pay the toll to an attendant. At automated
 * booths, a sensor on top of each booth scans an RFID card that's affixed to the windshield of your vehicle as you pass
 * the toll booth. It is easy to visualize the passage of vehicles through these toll stations as an event stream over
 * which interesting operations can be performed.
